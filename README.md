# Single-Cycle RISC-V 32-bit Processor

## Introduction
A single-cycle RISC-V 32-bit processor is a hardware implementation of a processor that follows the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) and executes each instruction in a single clock cycle. It is designed to provide a simple and efficient approach to computer architecture, emphasizing a reduced instruction set and a streamlined execution model.

## Features

- Single-cycle execution: Each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle.
- RISC-V ISA: Supports the RISC-V 32-bit instruction set.
- Instruction memory: The processor has separate instruction and data memories.
- Basic arithmetic and logic operations: Arithmetic and logic operations such as addition, subtraction, bitwise AND/OR,slt.
- Branch instructions: Conditional and unconditional branch instructions are implemented.
- Memory access: Load and store instructions for accessing data memory are supported.

## Usage


- Load Program: Load the program instructions into the instruction memory of the processor.

- Set Data Memory: Set the initial values of data memory locations as required by the program.

- Run Simulation: Execute the simulation of the processor, allowing the instructions to be fetched, decoded, and executed in a single clock cycle.

- Monitor Results: Monitor the processor's output, including any changes to the data memory or register values during the execution of the program.

- Analyze Performance: Analyze the performance of the processor by observing the timing of instruction execution and evaluating the overall efficiency of the design.
